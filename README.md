# 🌿 Yumi Finance — On-Chain BNPL Landing Page

**Yumi Finance** is the first fully on-chain **Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)** solution that pays you back.

This landing page is designed to communicate Yumi's value to consumers and merchants — featuring a modern, responsive UI inspired by Apple and Klarna. The interface avoids traditional "web3" aesthetics in favor of a clean, tech-forward experience.
